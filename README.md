# Introduction to my project
## This is my first project in GitHub
Firstly i didn't know anything about coding and computers and then it took one time to try it and i falled in love with it, from that moment onething that was on my mind was to continue, to continue learn about coding about software and in the first week it was not easy but what i learnt from it was is that if you want it, you should never give up
